A project analysing the evolution of the game and the influence of foreign playersGlobalization of the Game

NBA's Most Valuable Player is the Greek Giannis Antetokounmpo and the last FIBA World Cup champion was Spain and not the USA. 
As the number of players born outside the US continues to grow so is the evolution of the game.
The goal of this project is to determine if the increase in the number of foreign players is changing the way this game is played today.
